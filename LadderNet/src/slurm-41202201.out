Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) openmpi/2.1.1


the side H is not compatible with the selected stride of 5
img_h 584, patch_h 48, stride_h 5
(img_h - patch_h) MOD stride_h: 1
So the H dim will be padded with additional 4 pixels
the side W is not compatible with the selected stride of 5
img_w 565, patch_w 48, stride_w 5
(img_w - patch_w) MOD stride_w: 2
So the W dim will be padded with additional 3 pixels
